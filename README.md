Utils
----------

I will add some small utility programs I created for my personal use, here. These are in no way error proof and are for simple usage only.

List of current tools:
1. Word Merger -> Point this tool to a folder containing .docx files and it will merge them into a single .docx file and place it in the same folder
2. AWS_Utils / AWSLoadBalancerLoadTester -> This simple tool can be used to launch a set of web clients that perform a GET operation on the specified URL (an AWS ELB for example) for the specified number of times, in a different set of threads
